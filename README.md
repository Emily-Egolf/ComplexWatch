## Installation

- Download [Tizen Studio](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download)
- Open the **Tizen Package Manager** and install the 2.3.1 Wearable API
- In the package manager, go to the **Extension SDK** tab and install the **Samsung Certificate Extension** (I also have the **Samsung Wearable Extension** but it's probably not necessary)
- Clone the repository
- Open the Tizen IDE
- **File** > **Open projects from the file system**
- Import the cloned repo
- Follow [This Guide](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-watch-tizen/creating-your-first-app/native-watch-face.html#Running-on-a-Target-Device), during certificate creation  make sure you select **SAMSUNG** for the certificate profile type
